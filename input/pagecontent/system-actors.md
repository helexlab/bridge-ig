This page lists and describes the human users and digital services that interact with the system, derived from the business requirements defined at the operational level (L2). For more details about end-users and related stakeholders, see the [Generic Personas](personas.html).

Systems managing clinical and patient information are expected to interact with a shared health record, master data management and terminology systems, as appropriate, and to synchronize with data collected in a clinical encounter.

For additional actor definitions, see the [Digital Documentation of COVID-19 Certificates (DDCC) Implementation Guide](https://worldhealthorganization.github.io/ddcc/actors.html).

### Key generic personas interacting with the system

In the clinical flows, generic personas are represented using profiles of the various entity resources in HL7 FHIR, such as [Patient](http://hl7.org/fhir/patient), [Practitioner](http://hl7.org/fhir/practitioner), [PractitionerRole](http://hl7.org/fhir/practitionerrole), and [RelatedPerson](http://hl7.org/fhir/relatedperson).
